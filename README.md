Youth basketball in Calgary is confusing – or was for us when our kid’s first started – so we’ve created this to help parents navigate the basketball landscape in Calgary.  We will not provide specific organization recommends – that’s for you to decide.  This site is focused on explaining the landscape of youth basketball, including differences between community, club, age brackets, and seasons of play.

There are two options for league play in Calgary – community and club.  
Community
-	Divided into zones and where you register is determined by where you live.
-	Your child’s team will consist of other players within your zone.
-	Teams practice at a gym within their home zone and will play games (with official referees) against other zones through the city.
-	Community accepts everyone; there are no cuts.  Evaluations are held to place kids of similar skill levels on the same team, but everyone makes a team.  Because of this, community is a great option for anyone new to basketball – even at age 17, there will be a beginner / lower skilled team available to play on.
-	The season runs Sep-Feb with some teams qualifying for provincials in early-Mar.  
-	Community is volunteer run, so teams are coached by volunteers (generally a parent of a child on the team)
-	Since it’s volunteer run, this is generally your cheapest way to play organized basketball.
-	Community follows an equal playing time rule, which means each player will get equal minutes.
-	The time commitment for community is, generally, one practice and one game each week.

Club
-	You can pick any club in the city to play with – there are no address rules restricting what club you register with.
-	Most clubs rent gyms throughout the city.  A couple of clubs have their own facility, so the location is set/known prior to registration.
-	The club season is traditionally Mar-Jun each year although more-and-more, clubs are offering a fall season/league as well. 
-	Club teams are generally coached by professional coaches.  
-	Clubs are, generally, more expensive than community but that makes sense given the coaches are, generally, paid and the time commitment (number of practices and games) is, generally, greater with clubs.
-	Most clubs do not follow an equal playing time rule – important to ask potential clubs, if this is a concern.  Based on our experience, most parents switch clubs due to lack of playing time, which is unfortunate but understandable.
-	The time commitment for club is, generally, 2-3 practices per week plus games and tournaments on weekends.

Age Brackets
-	Community and Club follow the same terminology for age brackets.  You’ll generally see references to UXX where XX = age.  For example, U9 = under 9 and U11 = under 11.  Occasionally, you’ll see XXU, which represents XX and under.  For example, 9U = 9 and under, and 11U = 11 and under. This site will only reference UXX ages brackets as those are the most common.
-	For community, UXX is based on the age as at Dec 31 of the registration year.
o	Registration is open Jun-Aug each year and the age bracket is based on your child’s age as of Dec 31 that year.
o	I’m writing this in 2026, so if your child was born in 2014, your child would be U13 as at Dec 31, 2026 for the 2026-2027 community season.
-	For club, UXX is based on the age as at Dec 31 of the registration year in fall, however, it’s based on the Dec 31 of the prior year if registering for spring season.  
o	I’m writing this in 2026 and registration is open for many of the spring programs.  The cut-off date is as of Dec 31, 2025.  Therefore, a 2014 child would be considered U12 for the upcoming spring season.
o	If registering for the fall club season in 2026, a 2014 child would be considered U13 for the upcoming fall season.
o	Some clubs and tournaments will use an Aug 31 cut-off, but the majority follow Dec 31, so I won’t get into the Aug 31 difference on this page.
o	Whereas school grade is often used/considered – along with age – in the USA, it is rarely used/considered in Canada.
-	U9 is generally limited to 6-8 year olds (as of the cut-off date) but if you want to register your 5 year old and understand the risks (due size and skill differences at a young age), then reach out to the community or club to see if they’ll grant an exception; most will allow it.

U9 vs. U11+
-	At U9…
o	Community only runs in-house programs.  Meaning, you do not play against other teams across the city.
o	Clubs may offer in-house programs with a small commitment level (1-2 times per week), but some clubs do play in leagues and tournaments against other teams across the city even at U9, which may require a stronger time commitment.  Check with your club prior to registering.
-	At U11 and above, both community and club are focused on league play.  As mentioned above, the community time commitment is, generally, one practice and one game each week.  The time commitment for club is, generally, 2-3 practices per week along with league and tournament games.

Summary
If your child is just starting basketball, I strongly recommend you start with community although if you’ve missed the registration window (registration runs early Jun to mid Aug), then get involved with a club as you don’t want to wait a year to get your kid involved.  The time commitment with club is significant, so familiarize yourself with this prior to registering.
